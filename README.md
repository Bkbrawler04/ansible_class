This contains code primarily for instancing the class workstations. The target OS is Ubu 14.04.

Vagrant Instantiation
=====================

Provided that you have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com) and
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) installed, you should be able
to simply type `vagrant up`, and then `vagrant ssh`, and be connected to
a VM that will behave similarly to the AWS instances that were
originally provided for those attending this class live.  Enjoy!
